                <p class="bio-text">As a former Music Education major one year from graduating with a degree, and having been classically-trained for ten years on alto saxophone, I bring a unique perspective to the field of computer science. My many years of musical training brings a close attention to detail, an eye when it comes to noticing changes and problems, as well as the people skills needed to navigate professional relationships. My history of artistic expression has influenced my technicl skills to allow me to create clean, eloquent and well-structured code.</p>

                <p class="gear-text">When I started out as a wee saxophone lass, bright eyed and ready to conquer the world with My Sound™, I embarked on my musical journey with a Selmer Bundy II. This instrument, though rudimentary in sound quality and physical instrumental composition, is tough enough to withstand nearing fifteen years of middle school, high school, and collegiate marching band, early instrumental mispractices which include but are not limited to getting a botle of key oil wedged in the body of the horn, higher up in the tube than the bottom curve.  Upon the realization that my instrument really was the cause of all my problems and I really was practicing hard enough, I upgraded instruments, with the help of my saxophone instructor. I spent hours looking at the shiny Woodwind Brasswind catalog, tested multiple models from Yamaha, and Selmer, with a Mark VI for posterity, before trying a Yanigasawa 991, and a Yanigasawa 992. The decision was made when I played the copper-bodied 992 and my mom felt her purse shaking from across the room.  I am playing on a Selmer S80 mouthpiece, and a gold-plated Ishimori ligature. I play on Vandoren Blue Box 3.5's My neckstrap preference varies but I'm currently using a BG clarinet neckstrap (without stretching cords) and its among the most comfortable I've used. That said, my lesson instructor used a custom made leather neckstrap, put together with leather pieces and a simple band neckstrap, and I was always super jealous.</p>
