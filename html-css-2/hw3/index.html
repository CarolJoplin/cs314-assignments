            A beer you could drink all day and all night. Dark amber in color. A delectably complex malt profile reminiscent of bread, toast, and biscuits, with hints of caramel, chocolate, and fruity esters. Perfectly balanced bitterness from the earthy, floral hops. Take one sip and another is sure to immediately follow… and another… and another…

            Arriving in a 22-ounce brown bomber, this ale clocks in at 62 IBUs, which tells us there is a substantial amount of hops here, and a hefty 7.9 percent alcohol by volume speaks for itself. Decent amount of foam that holds together to form a chunky-looking head with good retention. Crystal-clear copper hue. Juicy aroma, pear-like fruity esters, rosewater, soft herbal tones and a hint of spicy alcohol in the back. Full-bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel, very smooth and creamy. Loads of hop oil up front, herbal, almost like nectar. Really juicy with an intermingled fruitiness of mango, pear and melon. Then the fruity esters show their real source with a warmth and spice of balanced alcohol; and bitterness has a go on the taste buds with a semi-puckering dryness. The malt character drops in fashionably late with undertones of toasted biscuit. The finish is a tad sweet, though if the hops fade with a bit of age and the alcohol goes a bit vinous, then, with time, this beer will turn into a different beast altogether.
